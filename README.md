### I have made Programming language Ye Bol 
##### So to make a programming language we need these 
+ Lexer : tokenize the code into words
+ AST : We have to make a syntax Tree
+ Code Generator : We can generate code in any language like c++ , python , js 
+ Executable : After code generated we get executable code and we can run that using respective compilers
